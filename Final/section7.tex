\section{Virtual Memory}
We expose a virtual memory space to applications so that they can
assume that they own the whole space, then the OS handles the mapping of virtual
to physical memory space.

\textbf{Page Table:} A data structure which contains virtual to physical address
mappings. If we haven't used a page in a while we can map it to disk memory instead
of DRAM. Page tables are mapping in a coarser granularity i.e 4Kb
