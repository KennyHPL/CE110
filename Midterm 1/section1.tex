\section{CPU Power Efficiency \& Consumption}
Chip Power Consumtion $= C*Vdd^2*F$\\
$C =$ capacitance, $Vdd = $ voltage, $F =$ frequency

\textbf{Dennard scaling:} As transistors get smaller their power density stays
contant, The supply voltage of a chip can be reduced by $~0.7x$ every generation \\
Dennard scaling held up in the past but now it's not holding up\\
$Power = C*Vdd^2*F_{0\rightarrow 1}+Vdd*I_{leakage}$
Leakage gets worse with samller devices and lower $Vdd$, it also gets worse with higher temps\\
$Energy = AvgPower * ExecutionTime$\\
$Joules = Watts * sec$ \\
\textbf{Amdahl's Law-}\\
We want to make the common case efficient, given an optimization x that accerlerates fraction $f_x$ of the program by a factor $S_x$, the overall speedup is
$\frac{1}{(1-f_x)+\frac{f_x}{S_x}}$

\subsection*{Performance}
\textbf{Latency:} how long it takes to do a task \\
\textbf{Throughput:} total work done per unit time \\
$ExeTime = \frac{Instrs}{Program}\frac{Clock cycles}{Instr}\frac{Sec}{ClockCycle}$\\
\textbf{Relative Performance:} define performance as = $1/ExecutionTime$\\
``X is n times faster than Y'' means $Perormance_x/Performance_y$\\
